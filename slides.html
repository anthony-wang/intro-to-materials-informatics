      # Introduction to Materials Informatics

      ---

      # Agenda

      1. Introductions

      2. Materials science

      3. Informatics

      4. Materials informatics

      5. Playing with some data

      ---

      # Class format

      - Lots of **interactive discussion and questions**

      - Some very basic coding and making plots at the end

      - Ask questions at any time (but please raise hand)

      - If you need to briefly leave for any reason (e.g. water / snack / bathroom / phone call), feel free to do so without asking and feel free to come back in (don't worry about interrupting)

      ---

      # Introduction

      - A little about me

      - Round-table student intros

      ---

      # What is Materials Science?

      <img src="img/doe_scales.jpg" width="600">

      ---

      # What are some core concepts of Materials Science?

      - Can anyone think of core concepts for more familiar fields, like **physics / biology / chemistry**?

      - How would you answer the question, "what is physics?" (or biology, or chemistry)

      ???

      [ Give examples like F=ma, biological cells, periodic table of elements ]

      ---

      # Crystal structures

      - What is a crystal? Can anyone give examples?

      <img src="img/crystal.png" width="300">

      ???

      [Show picture of crystal lattice and/or unit cell]

      [Useful because it lets us DESCRIBE MATERIALS]

      ---

      # DISCUSSION: Which ones are crystals?

      - Which of these are crystals? Which aren't? Why? See if you can convince your neighbor.

      <img src="img/mat_01.jpg" width="200">
      <img src="img/mat_02.jpg" width="300">

      ???

      [ Show a few images, macro/micro/atomic scale ]

      ---

      # Thermodynamic stability

      <img src="img/metastable_block.jpg" width="600">

      ???

      [Show pictures of something like lego blocks or whatever. What is stable? What is unstable? Why?]
      [Show idea of energy landscapes. What is stable? Unstable? Why?]
      [Explain metastable and unstable]

      [Useful because it tells us WHAT TO EXPECT FROM A MATERIAL]

      ---

      # DISCUSSION: Which ones are stable / metastable / unstable?

      - Which of these are stable? Metastable? Unstable? Why? See if you can convince your neighbor.

      <img src="img/stability_ball.svg" width="600">

      ???

      [ Show a few images, both materials and non-materials examples ]

      ---

      # DISCUSSION: Diamond stability?

      - Are diamonds stable? Metastable? Unstable? Why?

      <img src="img/diamond.png" width="600">

      ???

      - They're metastable, but why don't we see them decomposing? See if anyone can guess KINETICS / REACTION RATES

      ---

      # Kinetic barriers

      <img src="img/rollingboulder.gif" width="600">

      ???

      [ Use something like analogy of going from point A to point B but there's a hill in the way ]
      [ Shift analogy to energy landscape -- which point should be lower? What does the hill represent? ]

      [Useful because it tells us HOW/WHY MATERIALS CHANGE (ESPECIALLY SPEED/RATE)]

      ---

      # DISCUSSION: Fast and slow kinetics

      - How can you speed up a reaction? Why? See if you can convince your neighbor.

      ???

      [ Temperatures, catalysts, concentrations, surface area, ... ]


      ---

      # Material properties

      At the end of the day, we often care about what **properties** materials have. One general example is mechanical strength (e.g., doesn't break easily if you pull on it).

      - Can you think of other examples of useful properties? What kinds of materials might have these properties?

      ---

      # DISCUSSION: Thinking about properties

      - What **properties** do you think this material has?

      # Recap of materials science

      - We want to link between size scales [Why?]

      - Thermodynamic stability tells us... [???]

      - Kinetics tells us about... [???]

      - Usually we're very interested in a material's PROPERTIES

      ---

      # Informatics - what is it?

      - Let's contrast with 'first principles' reasoning: Which is heavier? A block of iron or a block of styrofoam (of same sizes)? Why?

      ---

      # What about a data-first approach?

      - Suppose you have 100 different blocks made from 100 different materials, and you've never heard of 'density' or 'volume' or 'atoms.' How would you find and describe which blocks are heavier?

      - Now imagine half of these materials are metals, and the other half are various kinds of wood. Could you come up with 'rules' to describe which half should be heavier? (and remember you don't know what 'density' is)

      ---

      # Data-first isn't always so silly

      - If I throw a ball in an arc, how do I figure out where it lands? [show projectile motion diagram]
      [ Show equations, but gloss over details and just show that you can get "x = something" ]

      - How old were you when you learned to throw/catch a baseball or football? Did you use algebra or physics? How did you learn?

      ---

      # DISCUSSION: Finding patterns in the data

      [ Show a table of some data and get people to try to predict a value based on extrapolating ]

      ---

      # Usually we want to find **models** from our data

      [Show diagram of 'best fit lines' and other easy examples]
      [Qualitatively explain the idea of error and fit, prediction and generalization]

      ---

      #DISCUSSION: But models aren't always so easy to find...

      [ Show underfit, good fit, overfit - get people to guess/explain which is which ]

      ---

      # "Machine learning" and "artificial intelligence"

      - Hot topics these days: but what are these fields about?
      - Lots of things, but one major theme is learning **models from the data**

      ---

      # An easy example: Binary Classification

      [ Go back to the wood/metal density problem ]

      ---

      # A cool machine learning example



      ---

      # Intro to Python

      - Simple programming language
        ```python
        from weather_functions import is_rainy_outside
        from outdoors_functions import is_sprinkler_on

        def should_bring_umbrella():
          return bool( is_rainy_outside() or is_sprinkler_on() )

        if should_bring_umbrella():
          bring_umbrella = True
        ```

      ---

      #Plotting is really simple
        ```python
        from plot_functions import plot_scatter
        from dataset import plot_data

        plot_scatter(plot_data['x'], plot_data['y'])
        ```

      ---

      # Materials informatics: the datasets

      - Periodic Table of Elements:

      - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bowserinator/Periodic-Table-JSON/master/PeriodicTableJSON.json

      [ Explain dataset schema ]

      ---

      # Plotting the data and looking for patterns

      - We will use https://studio.azureml.net/ as our Python environment

      [ Explain plotting setup ]

      ---

      # Examples

      [ Show a couple code examples ]
