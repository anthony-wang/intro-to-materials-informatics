      # Introduction to Materials Informatics

      ---

      # Agenda

      1. Introductions
      2. Materials science
      3. Informatics
      4. Materials informatics
      5. Playing with some data

      ---

      # Class format

      - Lots of interactive discussion and questions
      - Some very basic coding and making plots at the end
      - All course materials (code, slides, notes) available for free online at [link]
      - Ask questions at any time (but please raise hand)
      - If you need to briefly leave for any reason (e.g. water / snack / bathroom / phone call), feel free to do so without asking and feel free to come back in (don't worry about interrupting)

      ---

      # Introduction

      - A little about me
      - Round-table student intros

      ---

      # What is Materials Science?

      [ Show picture of different size scales; ask students what they think they are looking at ]
      [ A really core idea in matsci is linking between size scales ]

      ---

      # What are some core concepts of Materials Science?

      - Can anyone think of core concepts for more familiar fields, like physics / biology / chemistry?
      [ Give examples like F=ma, biological cells, periodic table of elements ]

      ---

      # Crystal structures

      - What is a crystal? Can anyone give examples?

      [Show picture of crystal lattice and/or unit cell]

      [Useful because it lets us DESCRIBE MATERIALS]

      ---

      # DISCUSSION: Which ones are crystals?

      [ Show a few images, macro/micro/atomic scale ]

      - Which of these are crystals? Which aren't? Why? See if you can convince your neighbor.

      ---

      # Thermodynamic stability

      [Show pictures of something like lego blocks or whatever. What is stable? What is unstable? Why?]
      [Show idea of energy landscapes. What is stable? Unstable? Why?]
      [Explain metastable and unstable]

      [Useful because it tells us WHAT TO EXPECT FROM A MATERIAL]

      ---

      # DISCUSSION: Which ones are stable / metastable / unstable?

      [ Show a few images, both materials and non-materials examples ]

      - Which of these are stable? Metastable? Unstable? Why? See if you can convince your neighbor.

      ---

      # Kinetic barriers

      [ Use something like analogy of going from point A to point B but there's a hill in the way ]
      [ Shift analogy to energy landscape -- which point should be lower? What does the hill represent? ]

      [Useful because it tells us HOW/WHY MATERIALS CHANGE (ESPECIALLY SPEED/RATE)]
      [Maybe show a picture example]

      ---

      # DISCUSSION: Fast and slow kinetics

      [ Give examples like diamond into graphite, or stirring a solution to mix something, or dissolving at different temperatures ]

      - Which of these are faster/slower? Why? See if you can convince your neighbor.

      ---

      # Material properties

      At the end of the day, we often care about what **measureable properties** materials have. One general example is mechanical strength (e.g., doesn't break easily if you pull on it).

      - Can you think of other examples of useful properties? What kinds of materials might have these properties?

      ---

      # DISCUSSION: Thinking about properties

      [ Show some images. Which is electrically conductive? Which is really buoyant? High compressive strength? High tensile strength? etc. ]

      ---

      # Recap of materials science

      - We want to link between size scales [Why?]
      - Thermodynamic stability tells us... [???]
      - Kinetics tells us about... [???]
      - Usually we're very interested in a material's PROPERTIES

      ---

      # Informatics - what is it?

      - Let's contrast with 'first principles' reasoning: Which is heavier? A block of iron or a block of styrofoam (of same sizes)? Why?

      ---

      # What about a data-first approach?

      - Suppose you have 100 different blocks made from 100 different materials, and you've never heard of 'density' or 'volume' or 'atoms.' How would you find and describe which blocks are heavier?

      - Now imagine half of these materials are metals, and the other half are various kinds of wood. Could you come up with 'rules' to describe which half should be heavier? (and remember you don't know what 'density' is)

      ---

      # Data-first isn't always so silly

      - If I throw a ball in an arc, how do I figure out where it lands? [show projectile motion diagram]
      [ Show equations, but gloss over details and just show that you can get "x = something" ]

      - How old were you when you learned to throw/catch a baseball or football? Did you use algebra or physics? How did you learn?

      ---

      # DISCUSSION: Finding patterns in the data

      [ Show a table of some data and get people to try to predict a value based on extrapolating ]

      ---

      # Usually we want to find **models** from our data

      [Show diagram of 'best fit lines' and other easy examples]
      [Qualitatively explain the idea of error and fit, prediction and generalization]

      ---

      #DISCUSSION: But models aren't always so easy to find...

      [ Show underfit, good fit, overfit - get people to guess/explain which is which ]

      ---

      # "Machine learning" and "artificial intelligence"

      - Hot topics these days: but what are these fields about?
      - Lots of things, but one major theme is learning **models from the data**

      ---

      # An example: Classification

      [ Go back to the wood/metal density problem ]

      ---

      # Materials informatics: the dataset

      [ Explain dataset schema ]

      ---

      # Plotting the data and looking for patterns

      [ Explain plotting setup ]

      ---

      # Examples

      [ Show a couple code examples ]
