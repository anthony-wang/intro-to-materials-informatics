      # Materials Informatics

      ---

      # Class goals

      - Give a survey of materials science, and machine learning

      - Provide **intuition** to help understand advanced concepts

      ---

      # Agenda

      1. Introductions

      2. Materials science

      3. Informatics and machine learning

      ---

      # Class format

      - Lots of **interactive discussion and questions**

      - Ask questions at any time (but please raise your hand)

      ---

      # Introduction

      - A little about me

      - About the class (Who is from Boston area? Massachusetts State? USA? Beyond USA?)

      # Crystal structures

      - What is a crystal? Can anyone give examples?

      [Show picture of crystal lattice and/or unit cell]

      [Useful because it lets us DESCRIBE MATERIALS]

      ---

      # Which ones are crystals?

      - See if you can convince your neighbor.

      # Atomic scale structure

      # Material properties

      We often are interested in what **properties** materials have...

      - What **properties** do you think this material has?

      # Informatics and Machine Learning

      # Informatics - what is it?

      - Let's contrast with 'first principles' reasoning: Which is heavier? A block of iron or a block of wood (of same sizes)? Why?

      # Data-first isn't always so silly

      - If I throw a ball in an arc, how do I figure out where it lands?

      ---

      # First principles VS data-driven

      - The goal is (often) **prediction** in both cases

      - First principles is used when a **theory** is able to predict the results

      - Data-driven methods are used when we must guess a model from **past experience** (or past data)

      # "Machine learning" and "artificial intelligence"

      - Hot topics these days: but what are these fields about?

      - Lots of things, but one major theme is learning **models from the data**


      ## Kinds of machine learning

      1. Unsupervised

      2. Supervised

      3. Semi-supervised

      # What we learned today

      - Materials science: studying "stuff" by understanding atoms, nano/microstructures, properties, etc.

      - Materials informatics: studying materials using data (usually machine learning techniques)
