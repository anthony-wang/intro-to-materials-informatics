# Introduction to Materials Informatics
This repository contains all the materials needed for a stand-alone, single introductory lecture for materials informatics. The assumptions are that students:

- Don't need to know any math beyond basic elementary school mathematics
- Don't necessarily know any formal science or programming

The goal of the lecture is to do the following:

- Provide a broad introduction to the field of materials science
- Introduce 'informatics' by contrasting it with *ab initio* perspectives
- Allow students to generate some cool and informative plots, using real (but relatively simple) materials science data
