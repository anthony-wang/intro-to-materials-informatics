      # Materials Informatics

      ---

      # Class goals

      - Give a survey of materials science, and machine learning

      - Provide **intuition** to help understand advanced concepts

      ---

      # Agenda

      1. Introductions

      2. Materials science

      3. Informatics and machine learning

      ---

      # Class format

      - Lots of **interactive discussion and questions**

      - Ask questions at any time (but please raise your hand)

      ---

      # Introduction

      - A little about me

      - About the class (Who is from Boston area? Massachusetts State? USA? Beyond USA?)

      # Crystal structures

      - What is a crystal? Can anyone give examples?

      ???

      [Show picture of crystal lattice and/or unit cell]

      [Useful because it lets us DESCRIBE MATERIALS]

      ---

      # DISCUSSION: Which ones are crystals?

      - Which of these are crystals? Which aren't? Why? See if you can convince your neighbor.

      # Nanostructures

      <img src="img/nanowires.png" width="400">

      ---

      # Material properties

      At the end of the day, we often care about what **properties** materials have. One general example is mechanical strength (e.g., doesn't break easily if you pull on it).


      ---

      # DISCUSSION: Thinking about properties

      - What **properties** do you think this material has?


      <img src="img/aerogel.jpg" width="300">

      ---

      # Recap of materials science

      - We want to link between size scales (and between structure / properties)

      # Informatics - what is it?

      - Let's contrast with 'first principles' reasoning: Which is heavier? A block of iron or a block of wood (of same sizes)? Why?

      # Data-first isn't always so silly

      - If I throw a ball in an arc, how do I figure out where it lands?

      ---

      # First principles VS data-driven

      - The goal is (often) **prediction** in both cases

      - First principles is used when a **theory** is able to predict the results

      - Data-driven methods are used when we must guess a model from **past experience** (or past data)

      <img src="img/schrodinger.jpg" width="500">

      # DISCUSSION: Finding patterns in the data

      X1 = `[ 01, 02, 03, 04, 05 ]`

      Y1 = `[ 01, 04, ??, 16, 25 ]`

      ***

      X2 = `[ 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07 ]`

      Y2 = `[ 01, 01, 02, 03, 05, 08, ?? ]`

      ***

      X3 = `[ 04, 05, 07, 03, 24, 12, 35, 18 ]`

      Y3 = `[ 01, 00, 00, 00, 01, 01, 00, ?? ]`

      # We want to find **models** from our data

      - What is the line here? What determines where it should be drawn?

      - If the temperature rises to 30C, how much money will you make?

      ???

      [Show diagram of 'best fit lines' and other easy examples]

      [Qualitatively explain the idea of error and fit, prediction and generalization]

      #DISCUSSION: But models aren't always so easy to find...

      # "Machine learning" and "artificial intelligence"

      - Hot topics these days: but what are these fields about?

      - Lots of things, but one major theme is learning **models from the data**


      ## Kinds of machine learning

      1. Unsupervised

      2. Supervised

      3. Semi-supervised

      # What we learned today

      - Materials science: studying "stuff" by understanding atoms, nano/microstructures, properties, etc.
      - Materials informatics: studying materials using data (usually machine learning techniques)
